# 100 Days of SwiftUI

Welcome to my **100 Days of SwiftUI** repository! This repository contains a collection of mini-projects and exercises created while following the "100 Days of SwiftUI" series created by Paul Hudson on his website, Hacking with Swift.

## Overview
This repository is designed to showcase my learning journey as I build various SwiftUI projects. Each day focuses on different SwiftUI concepts, features, and techniques, culminating in hands-on mini-projects.

## Projects
The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a day or project in the series. Here's the current structure:

```
xj-100-days-of-swiftui/
├── Project01/
├── Project02/
├── Project03/
├── ... etc
...
```

## Summaries
This section contains brief summaries of each project to track the concepts and techniques covered:

- **Project01 - WeSplit:** Working with **forms** and **sections**, **navigation stacks**, managing program state with **@State** and **@FocusState**, creating controls like **TextField** and **Picker**, and dynamically generating views with **ForEach**.

- **Project02 - GuessTheFlag:** Exploring **stacks (HStack, VStack, ZStack)** to arrange views, customizing the interface with colors, gradients, backgrounds, and frames. Adding interactivity with **Button** and **Label** views, and displaying user feedback with **Alerts**.
  
  Personal Add-ons: Dynamic effects, such as visual feedback when the user gets the answer right (e.g., green overlay) or wrong (e.g., red overlay), a timeout mechanic that progressively fades the screen from blue to black, ending the game when time runs out.
